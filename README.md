TMX to Jason converter. 
A handy converter for translation memories or training LLM Models. To use it, you need to have the following Python libraries.
Here is a list of the libraries I used in the script for processing TMX files:

tkinter - for creating the graphical user interface (GUI).

xml.etree.ElementTree (ET) - for working with XML files and processing TMX format.

pandas - for working with tabular data (for example, for exporting to CSV, Excel or Parquet).

csv - for writing data in CSV format.

json - for working with JSON files.

yaml - for working with YAML files.

zipfile - for working with archives (zip files).

os - for operations with system files.

shutil - for working with file operations, such as copying directories and files.

If you are using the script on different machines or with different configurations, I recommend checking if all these libraries are installed on your system. You can install them using pip:
